# osm_can_bics

OSM Can-BICS classifies OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, according to the Canadian Bikeway Comfort and Safety Classification System (Can-BICS). The goal is to create a national map of bicycling facilities that is up-to-date, detailed, and uses lables that are meaningful for cycling safety and preference.

There are two main sections to the code:
1. Analyse 15 Sample cities to develop the classification and perform an accuracy assessment.
2. Processing the national dataset.
